v0.2.5
- Fixed a bug where successful fence actions where exiting improperly, causing
  DRBD to think the fence had actually failed.

v0.2.4
- Moved all variable declerations to the start of functions for future
  maintainability.
- Change to_log()'s passed-in "line" variable to "line_num" to avoid confusion
  between the usual use of "line" as the string used to record output from
  IO::Handle calls.

v0.2.3
- Changed the order of many 'if' statements that came after statements to the
  front of statements for consistency and maintainability reasons.

v0.2.2
- Changed kill_node()'s return to "1" unless the the fence succeeds.

v0.2.1
- Changed the 'drbdadm get-gi <res>' call to instead parse '/proc/drbd' to be
  more reliable. Also now only check for the textual 'UpToDate' to determine if
  the script will proceed with the fence action.
- Removed the use of 'logger' in favor of directly writing to syslog.

v0.1
- All new. Functionally similar to "obliterate-peer.sh".
